## 🔍 Overview

This work introduces **Explainable Driver Attention Prediction (EDAP)** — a novel task that jointly predicts:

- 🧭 **Where**: pixel-level driver attention maps  
- 🧩 **What**: semantic understanding of attended regions  
- 🧠 **Why**: cognitive reasoning behind the attention

We present:

- **W³DA**: The first large-scale dataset with spatial, semantic, and causal annotations across normal, critical, and accident driving scenarios.
- **LLada**: A multimodal large language model (MLLM)-driven architecture that unifies pixel prediction, semantic parsing, and causal reasoning in an end-to-end framework.

## 🛠️ To-Do List

We are actively building this repository. The full code and cleaned dataset will be released progressively. Stay tuned!

- [ ] Initial Code Release (Coming Soon)
- [ ] Refactored & Cleaned Code
- [ ] Cleaned W³DA Dataset Release
